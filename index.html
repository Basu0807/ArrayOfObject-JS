      In this example, the map method is used to iterate over each object in the
      studentRecords array. For each object, the name property is accessed and
      converted to uppercase using the toUpperCase() method. The resulting array
      of uppercase names is stored in the studentNames variable.

      the filter method is used to iterate over each object in the
      studentRecords array. The callback function checks if the marks property
      of each student is greater than 50. If true, the student object is
      included in the passedStudents array.

      , the filter method is used to iterate over each object in the
      studentRecords array. The callback function checks if the marks property
      of each student is greater than 50 and the id property is greater than
      120. Only the students who satisfy both conditions will be included in the
      filteredStudents array. The output will be an array of student objects who
      scored more than 50 marks and have IDs greater than 120:

      Q-4 Consider the same scenario we have discussed above, but this time we

      the reduce method is used to iterate over each object in the
      studentRecords array. The accumulator sum is initialized with a value of
      0. For each student, their marks property is added to the sum. The final
      result is the total sum of all the marks.

    <p>
      the filter method is used to iterate over each object in the
      studentRecords array and filter out the students who scored more than 50
      marks. Then, the map method is used to extract only the name property of
      each remaining student. The output will be an array containing the names
      of the students who scored more than 50 marks:

      the filter method is used to iterate over each object in the
      studentRecords array and filter out the students with IDs greater than
      120. Then, the reduce method is used to calculate the sum of their marks.
      The initial value of the accumulator sum is set to 0, and for each
      student, their marks property is added to the sum. The output will be the
      sum of marks of the students with IDs greater than 120:

      Q-7 This time we are required to print the total marks of the students

    <p>
      The map method is used to iterate over each student record and modify the
      marks if necessary by adding 15 to those who scored less than 50. The
      updated array is returned. The filter method is then used to filter out
      the students whose marks are still less than or equal to 50. Finally, the
      reduce method is used to sum up the marks of the filtered students,
      starting from an initial value of 0.
